    "## üìÑ Summary: Identify Different Batch and Streaming Data Sources  \n",
    "**Project:** `gcp_batch_vs_streaming.ipynb`  \n",
    "**Role:** Cloud Data Analyst, TheLook eCommerce  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this BigQuery lab, I analyzed the differences between batch and streaming data sources by inspecting live tables, executing queries on dynamic datasets, and formatting time-based aggregations for near real-time dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Objectives\n",
    "- Determine whether BigQuery tables use **streaming** or **batch** loading.\n",
    "- Run time-based queries on the `shopping_cart` and `orders` tables.\n",
    "- Join multiple tables to create category-specific dashboards.\n",
    "- Use **timestamp formatting** and **aggregation** techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Key Skills Demonstrated\n",
    "- Real-time query analysis using **streaming buffers** in BigQuery\n",
    "- Table inspection through the **Details** and **Streaming Statistics** tabs\n",
    "- **INNER JOIN** between product metadata and transactional logs\n",
    "- Time-window filtering using `TIMESTAMP_SUB()` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`\n",
    "- Formatted time slicing with `FORMAT_TIMESTAMP()` for grouped analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used\n",
    "- Verified live data ingestion by re-running queries and observing updates in `shopping_cart`\n",
    "- Differentiated batch-only `orders` table from streaming-capable `shopping_cart`\n",
    "- Filtered and grouped cart additions by **minute** using:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP(\"%H:%M\", sc.created_at)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Built an analytical query combining filters on product category and event time\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Insight Delivered\n",
    "Created a real-time minute-by-minute dashboard of items (specifically `Jeans`) added to shopping carts. This enabled merchandising stakeholders to monitor pricing effectiveness and stock decisions in near real time.\n",
