- Generate views from BigQuery tables
- Define custom measures and dimensions
- Build an Explore to join and analyze user and order data
- Save and visualize metrics with a Look

## Artifacts

- `manifest.lkml`: Project manifest with dataset and connection config
- `dimensions_and_measures.model.lkml`: LookML model configuration
- `order_items.view.lkml`, `users.view.lkml`: Views for modeling and aggregation
- `README.md`: Overview and guidance
