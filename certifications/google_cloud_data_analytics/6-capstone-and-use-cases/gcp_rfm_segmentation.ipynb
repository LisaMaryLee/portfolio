    "## üìÑ Summary: Apply RFM Method to Segment Customer Data  \n",
    "**Project:** `gcp_rfm_segmentation.ipynb`  \n",
    "**Role:** Cloud Data Analyst, TheLook eCommerce  \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab demonstrates how to apply the Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) method using BigQuery to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The RFM segmentation supports targeted marketing strategies by identifying loyal, high-value, at-risk, and persuadable customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Objectives\n",
    "- Explore customer and order data from the `thelook_ecommerce` dataset\n",
    "- Calculate Recency using `DATE_DIFF()` and most recent order timestamps\n",
    "- Count Frequency of orders per customer using `COUNT()`\n",
    "- Sum Monetary value of purchases using `SUM(sale_price)`\n",
    "- Build CTEs to organize intermediate computations\n",
    "- Apply `NTILE(4)` for quartile-based segmentation\n",
    "- Use `CASE` logic to assign customer segments based on quantiles\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Key Skills Demonstrated\n",
    "- SQL-based customer segmentation in BigQuery\n",
    "- Joining multiple datasets (`orders` and `order_items`) to aggregate purchase behavior\n",
    "- Creation of layered Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n",
    "- Use of analytical functions like `NTILE()` for quantile calculation\n",
    "- Conditional logic with `CASE` to classify customer segments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used\n",
    "- Calculated **recency** of last purchase:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), MAX(created_at), DAY)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Measured **frequency** using `COUNT(order_id)`\n",
    "- Summed **monetary** value using `SUM(sale_price)`\n",
    "- Structured multi-step analysis with nested `WITH` clauses (CTEs)\n",
    "- Assigned segment labels like:\n",
    "  - High Value Customer\n",
    "  - Loyal Customer\n",
    "  - At Risk Customer\n",
    "  - Persuadable Customer\n",

    "Segmented customers based on behavior to inform targeted marketing decisions. Enabled Martina's team to focus on loyalty campaigns, re-engagement strategies, and upsell efforts using statistically grounded RFM scoring.\n",
