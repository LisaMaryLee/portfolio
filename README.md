# 🎓 Lisa Mary Lee's Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my active engineering portfolio — a curated collection of working projects, cloud-native codebases, and real-world labs built during professional certifications and hands-on development.

This repo goes beyond coursework: it features production-ready APIs, machine learning pipelines, DevOps tooling, and system-level architecture that reflect my applied expertise in cloud infrastructure, ML/AI engineering, security, and technical program delivery.

Each directory represents a live or maintained codebase that demonstrates my ability to architect, build, and ship technical solutions across cloud, data, and AI domains.
